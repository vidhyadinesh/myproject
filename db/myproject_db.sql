It\'ll get you out of the house, get you with other people, and put a few bucks in your pocket. If you love programming enough, you\'ll find time to keep it going on the side.\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003ci\\u003eI\'m deeply depressed and contemplating suicide\\u003c/i\\u003e\\u003cp\\u003eDon\'t. Contact me anytime (see my profile). When things are going well, they\'re never as good as they seem. When they are going poorly, they\'re never as bad as they seem.\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003ci\\u003eI have to constantly hear my father shout what an idiot I am for quitting a high-paying job\\u003c/i\\u003e\\u003cp\\u003eFathers are sometimes wrong. Yours is now. Don\'t listen to him.\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003ci\\u003eMy friends make fun of me for making a retarded life decision.\\u003c/i\\u003e\\u003cp\\u003eWhen things get tough, you find out who you\'re friends really are. I know it\'s not much consolation, but you just did. Be glad you saved a lot of time and energy. Anyone who makes fun of you was never your friend, just an acquaintence.\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003ci\\u003eI can\'t really do anything else, since apparently finding a new job, is kind of hard and I have to go through the whole step where I admit my failure and start over and I don\'t even know what I want anymore.\\u003c/i\\u003e\\u003cp\\u003eDon\'t ever say \\\"can\'t\\\" because it\'s not true. You can. Just find any job and go from there. First you crawl, then you walk, then you run. Many of us have already been there. You can do it too.\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003ci\\u003eI thought I would become free, but I\'ve actually become less free as a result of it.\\u003c/i\\u003e\\u003cp\\u003eSo far. What you don\'t see now since you are in the midst of this is that this was just one backward (or sideways) step in a long journey forward. I don\'t know anyone who is successful that had only forward steps. We have all had these backward steps. It sounds like this may have been your first big one. That might be why it hurts so much.\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003ci\\u003eI\'m 20, I have no college diploma, no high school diploma, ...\\u003c/i\\u003e\\u003cp\\u003eNone of that matters. All that really matters is what\'s inside your head and your heart. Once you decide to start taking positive steps, you\'ll see.\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003ci\\u003eI\'m an idiot, essentially.\\u003c/i\\u003e\\u003cp\\u003ePlease don\'t ever say that. You\'re not, and I have proof: If you were really an idiot, then you wouldn\'t have posted this here.\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003ci\\u003eIt just didn\'t work out and it feels very painful.\\u003c/i\\u003e\\u003cp\\u003eThanks for the warning. You may have just saved a lot of people a lot of pain with this post.\\u003cp\\u003eAnd thanks for your story. I have been there (several times) as I imagine many others here have as well. It gets better. I promise. But you have to stop feeling miserable and take a positive step. Posting here was your first step. Talking to some of us off-line may be another. And getting out of the house and finding a job, any job, is probably your next best step.\\u003cp\\u003ePlease give it a shot a keep us posted. We\'re not going anywhere and we care.
